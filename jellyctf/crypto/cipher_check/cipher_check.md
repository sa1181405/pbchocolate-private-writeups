### Board
This is the completed board:

```
  a b c d e f g h
8 F O L L O W M O
7 I S T D U E L X
6 Q C I N D E T A
5 I L O N S P E C
4 I A L L I N E U
3 P E V E N T H E
2 W O N M A T E I
1 N 6 M O V E S !
```

This reads `FOLLOW MOIST DUEL XQC IN DETAIL ON SPECIAL LINEUP EVEN THE WON MATE IN 6 MOVES!`, which refers to [this chess game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91M0XLX7Jw).
```
[Event "?"]
[Site "?"]
[Date "????.??.??"]
[Round "?"]
[White "?"]
[Black "?"]
[Result "0-1"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. c3 Qf6 6. Nxc6 Qxf2# 0-1
```

Note that the board looks suspiciously like a chessboard.
When we map each square a piece lands on in the game to a letter on the board, we get the 12 letter string `ISTILLLOVEIT`.

Flag: `jellyCTF{ISTILLLOVEIT}`
