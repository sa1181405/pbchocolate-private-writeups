Description: I heard there's some ERP happening in the JellyCTF discord away from prying eyes... see if you can find any info on the places they're hanging out. Note: can be completed passively, do not send messages to DMs/channels about this chal

This solution was most likely unintended. Vencord, a discord client modification, has a plugin called "ShowHiddenChannels" [Plugin](https://vencord.dev/plugins/ShowHiddenChannels)

Because I had this plugin enabled, I am allowed to see the names of hidden channels but cannot read what is inside of them.

This is what the discord server had in terms of hidden channels.
