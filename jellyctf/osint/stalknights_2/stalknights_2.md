On the left, there are signs reading Bright Festival. This is likely the [Bright Festival in Brussels](https://www.visit.brussels/en/visitors/agenda/bright-festival). We now know that this photo may be taken in Brussels, Belgium. On the right, we see a large 28 sign. This matches the sign of the [Brasserie 28](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3i5AoFKPKbQzZTAx7). We can go into [Google streetview](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KP6Ah7GAhUfEjwcf6) to confirm that this is the same place. The park nearby is called Square de la putterie.
