Description: Fine.. NOW all the bugs have been fixed.

Huh? There's complaints that customers have not received their orders?

Hmm... maybe the shop should have asked for a shipping address. Anyway, that's also fixed now!

As usual, lets check the source.

```

Again, a buffer overflow in the input of address!

`fgets(address, 1000, stdin);`

For this challenge, I just randomly inputted many A's until I observed how many overflowed the next memory address. In this case, itâ€™s likely that the `coin_balance` variable is located in the memory directly after the address buffer.

So, 162 "A"'s give a balance of `672065` and 163 "A"'s give a balance of `172048705`

And now we can buy the coffee flag!

There it is! Our flag!
