With no info and only the challenge title, my best bet was to look at the streams that this CTF was targeted towards, that being Jelly Hoshiumi.

Upon visiting her youtube and live streams, I see a particular [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH8LKkIVHzI) that was made specifically for playing this CTF.

After skimming the entire video, no flag was found. So, I checked the description.

And guess what, the flag was there!

Final flag: `jellyCTF{jerrywashere123}`
