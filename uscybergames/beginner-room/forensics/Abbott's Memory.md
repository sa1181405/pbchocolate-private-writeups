Description: Always forgetting the password...

There were a few ways to solve this problem. However, the unintended solve was to use strings and grep for the beginning of the flag, being SIVBGR{

The creator has forgot to take this out of strings, hence being solved pretty fast.

Final flag: `SIVBGR{A1I3N5_At3_My_H0M3W0rK}`

Intended solve (this was from the challenge creator)
